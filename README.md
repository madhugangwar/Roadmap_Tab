# Roadmap_Tab
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#Features

Tabs: Tabs are highlighted on hover and clicking a tab reveals a new set of content.

Separation of Concerns: The project is structured with separate files for HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (functionality).

#File Structure
Tab.html: The main HTML file that provides the structure for the web page, including the tabs and the content area.

Tab.css: The stylesheet that provides the visual design for the tabs, the content area, and the hover effects.

Tab.js: The JavaScript file that handles the interactive behavior of the tabs, dynamically changing the content based on which tab is clicked
